Built a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system for Hindi using the WikiAnn dataset. Leveraged HuggingFace Transformers with a pre-trained multilingual BERT model. Performed token classification after aligning entity labels with tokenized outputs. Fine-tuned the model using the HuggingFace Trainer API and evaluated performance on the test set.
